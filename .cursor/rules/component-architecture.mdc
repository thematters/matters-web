# Component Architecture

Matters Web follows a component-based architecture using React and Next.js.

## Component Organization

Reusable components are organized in the `src/components/` directory, each in its own folder with the following structure:

```
ComponentName/
  ├── index.tsx              # Main component export
  ├── styles.module.css      # Component styles
  ├── gql.ts                 # GraphQL queries/mutations (if needed)
  └── ComponentName.test.tsx # Component tests
```

## Component Types

- **UI Components**: Pure presentational components
- **Compositions Components**: Components that are built on top of other UI components and may include GraphQL fragments as part of their UI requirements

## Key Component Directories

- [src/components/Layout](mdc:src/components/Layout): Page layout components
- [src/components/Form](mdc:src/components/Form): Form input components
- [src/components/Button](mdc:src/components/Button): Button components
- [src/components/Dialog](mdc:src/components/Dialog): Modal dialog components
- [src/components/GlobalDialogs](mdc:src/components/GlobalDialogs): App-wide dialogs
- [src/components/GlobalToasts](mdc:src/components/GlobalToasts): Toast notification system
