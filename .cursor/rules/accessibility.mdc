# Accessibility (A11Y)

Matters Web follows these accessibility best practices to ensure the platform is usable by everyone.

## Semantic HTML

Use semantic HTML elements to provide meaning and structure:

- `<header>`: Page header or section header
- `<nav>`: Navigation menus
- `<main>`: Main content area
- `<section>`: Standalone section of content
- `<article>`: Self-contained composition (e.g., blog post)
- `<aside>`: Content tangentially related to the content around it
- `<footer>`: Footer for page or section
- `<figure>` and `<figcaption>`: Images with captions
- `<button>`: For interactive elements that perform an action
- `<a>`: Only for navigation to a new page or location within page

Non-semantic elements like `<div>` and `<span>` should only be used when no semantic element is appropriate.

## WAI-ARIA

Use ARIA attributes when HTML semantics aren't sufficient:

- `role`: Define the purpose of an element (e.g., `role="alert"`, `role="dialog"`)
- `aria-label`: Provide an accessible name (e.g., `aria-label="Close dialog"`)
- `aria-labelledby`: Reference another element as the label
- `aria-describedby`: Reference descriptive text for an element
- `aria-expanded`: Indicate if expandable element is open or closed
- `aria-hidden`: Hide decorative elements from screen readers
- `aria-live`: For dynamically updating content

## Focus Management

- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Maintain a logical tab order
- Make focus visible with clear focus indicators
- Trap focus inside modals with `<FocusLock>` component by `react-focus-lock`

## Images

- Always include `alt` text for images
- Use empty `alt=""` for decorative images

## Forms

- Associate labels with form controls using `htmlFor`
- Group related form elements with `<fieldset>` and `<legend>`
- Provide clear error messages and validation
- Use appropriate input types (e.g., `type="email"`)

## Components

Our accessible components include:

- `<Button>`: Accessible button component
- `<Dialog>`: Accessible modal dialog with focus management
- `<Form>`: Accessible form controls with proper labeling
