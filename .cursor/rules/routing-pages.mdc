# Routing & Page Structure

Matters Web uses Next.js file-based routing with a combination of pages and views, with routes centrally defined in `src/common/enums/route.ts`.

## Route Configuration

- `src/common/enums/route.ts`: Central definition of all routes and paths
  - `PROTECTED_ROUTES`: Routes requiring authentication
  - `ROUTES`: Complete list of application routes
  - `PATHS`: Route key to pathname mapping

## Routing Structure

- `src/pages/`: Next.js pages define application routes
- Dynamic routes use brackets in filenames (e.g., `[name].tsx`, `[shortHash]`)
- Nested routes are organized in subdirectories

## Page Structure

Pages typically just export a view component from `src/views/`

## Key Routes

- `/`: Homepage
- `/[name]`: User profile page
- `/a/[shortHash]`: Article detail page
- `/e/[shortHash]`: Event (campaign) detail page
- `/~[name]`: Circle detail page
- `/tags/[tagId]`: Tag detail page
- `/me/*`: User private pages (e.g. drafts, bookmarks, settings)

## Route Utilities

- `src/components/Hook/useRoute.ts`: Hook for route management
- `src/common/utils/route.ts`: Functions for path generation and navigation
