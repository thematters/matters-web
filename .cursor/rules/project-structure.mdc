# Project Structure

Matters Web is a Next.js application that serves as the frontend for Matters.town, a decentralized content publishing platform.

## Main Directories

- `src/components/`: Reusable UI components organized by functionality
- `src/pages/`: Contains Next.js pages that define application routes
- `src/views/`: Page-level components used by the pages directory
- `src/common/`: Shared utilities, constants, styles, and helpers
- `src/gql/`: TypeScript types for GraphQL queries and mutations that generated based on GraphQL schema by `gen:type` command
- `src/definitions/`: TypeScript type definitions
- `public/`: Static assets including images, icons, and other resources

## Icons

We use [SVGR](mdc:https:/react-svgr.com) to transform SVGs into React components. For reusability and bundle optimization:

To add a new icon to the project:

1. Export 24x24px icon from Figma to `public/static/icons/24px`
2. If the icon color isn't static, replace the values of `fill` and `stroke` attributes with `currentColor`, and add `fill="none"` to `<svg>`

## Key Files
